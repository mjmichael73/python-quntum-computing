## Hey 

### Example 1:

    The first program.
    Which applies Hadamard gate to the first qubit and a CX gate to the second qubit,
    Then measures both qubits.

### Example 2:

    A quantum program that implements Grover's algorithm, Which is a search algorithm that can be used to find a marked item in an unsorted database with fewer queries that classical algorithms.
